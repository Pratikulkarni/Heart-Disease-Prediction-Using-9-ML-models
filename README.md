Heart Disease Risk Prediction
This project aims to identify key risk factors for heart disease and predict the overall risk using nine popular machine learning models. By analyzing critical features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, we evaluate which factors are most influential in determining heart disease risk.

We employ the following machine learning models:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes (NB)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Decision Tree
XGBoost
Gradient Boosting
AdaBoost
Each model is trained and evaluated on a heart disease dataset to determine the model that provides the most accurate predictions, helping to assess and mitigate potential risks of heart disease in individuals.
