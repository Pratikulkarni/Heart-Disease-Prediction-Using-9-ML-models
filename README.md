# ❤️🔍 Heart Disease Risk Prediction
Welcome to the Heart Disease Risk Prediction project! This project identifies the most influential risk factors of heart disease and provides an accurate prediction of overall risk using a variety of machine learning models. 🧠💡

🚀 Project Highlights
✨ Goal: Identify significant factors that impact heart disease risk

✨ Models Used: 9 diverse ML algorithms for robust prediction

✨ Data Insights: Explore crucial features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more


📊 Machine Learning Models
We explore the following models to predict heart disease risk:

🔹 Logistic Regression 📈

🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 👥

🔹 Naive Bayes (NB) 📊

🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM) 🧩

🔹 Random Forest 🌳🌳

🔹 Decision Tree 🌲

🔹 XGBoost 🚀

🔹 Gradient Boosting 🌄

🔹 AdaBoost 💪

🏆 Objective
Each model is trained on a heart disease dataset 🩺 to evaluate and rank the accuracy of predictions, guiding early detection and prevention. With a thorough analysis of risk factors, we strive to offer insights that support proactive healthcare decisions. 🌟
